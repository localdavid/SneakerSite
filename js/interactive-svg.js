	// jQuery.load loads the SVG file into our #stage div and give it the class svgLoaded which weâ€™ll later use to trigger our intro animation. Important: We load the SVG using JavaScript to gain access to its DOM. Chrome (and maybe other browsers) will not let you do this locally; it only works when run from the HTTP protocol for security reasons. So if you are having issues getting the SVG to load, be sure you are testing from a web server or running on localhost
